- a solution which works for literally every single project
	- like there shouldn't be a single project in the whole world which doesn't need us
- a solution so good you don't need it (gh? don't need it just use git lol)


DONT FORGET FACTORIO IS A GAME ABOUT AUTOMATION
- so screw the first time guys check out this url flow
- or maybe it just redirects you to .... whatever idk




- compute: daemons
- us: tasks - functions with inputs/outputs and maybe state
	- stage: git, preferably as minimal as possible

- we should be as fundamental as compute, networking, and storage
- git for vcs - this is a natural extension? or... who cares this is the everhything task runner

makefile for ci
just ci how ci was supposed to be from the start

whats the diff between dependabot/renovate and ci

doesn't matter - factorio is a game about automation, so you can start by automating the simple shit

not deployment - that's handled by cf pages push or whatever
- note: we could make deployment, but that would be pointless :) that says something about the existing providers :) - they are good!




never have not the best possible experience


config:
- file based config - generate with cursor then run the cli or something
- interactive/live system config (idk)


- always run locally, right after what you are doing
	- don't run the whole test suite and ci lint if all u changed was one thing



- run every task locally or remotely
	- build
	- update deps
	- deploy

- ANY WORKFLOW - EVERY WORKFLOW







i've made this list like 20 times.....
- just start with what you know..

contenders


deployment - preview deployments?
cf pages
- push from cli
- or let them hook up to ur git repo
heroku push to deploy


ci - run locally?
gh actions - gh actions feels bad

laminar - unixy lol, must self host - maybe thats what ci should be after all....
